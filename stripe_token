Sure, I can help you with that. Here is a step-by-step procedure to create a bank account token in Stripe Flutter using a simple form:

1. First, you need to add the `flutter_stripe` package to your project. You can do this by adding the following line to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_stripe: ^9.0.0+1
```

2. Next, import the `flutter_stripe` package in your Dart code:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_stripe/flutter_stripe.dart';
```

3. Create a form widget that contains the fields for collecting the bank account details from the user. You can use the `TextFormField` widget to create input fields for each of the required details.

4. In your form widget, create a `RaisedButton` widget that triggers the creation of a bank account token when pressed. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```dart
RaisedButton(
  child: Text('Create Bank Account Token'),
  onPressed: () async {
    final bankAccount = BankAccount(
      accountHolderName: 'John Doe',
      accountNumber: '000123456789',
      routingNumber: '110000000',
      countryCode: 'US',
      currency: 'usd',
    );

    final token = await Stripe.instance.createToken(
      CreateTokenParams.bankAccount(bankAccount: bankAccount),
    );

    print(token.id);
  },
);
```

5. When the user presses the button, the `createToken` method is called with a `CreateTokenParams` object that contains the bank account details entered by the user. The method returns a `TokenData` object that contains the bank account token.

6. Finally, you can use the bank account token to create a customer or charge in Stripe.
